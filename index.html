	<p>	► <font size=7>P</font>andit Jawaharlal Nehru was  a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist and a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence
        in 1947, he served as the country's first<b> Prime Minister</b>for 16 years.</p>
<p>►   He joined the <b>Indian National Congress</b> and became a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi, who called him his political heir.He advocated for parliamentary democracy, secularism,
	   socialism, and science and technology in India.</p>
<p>►   In foreign affairs, he played a leading role in establishing the <b>Non-Aligned Movement</b>, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the
      <b> Cold War</b>.</p> 
<p>►   Jawaharlal Nehru was affectionately called <u>Chacha Nehru</u> ("Uncle Nehru") by children, and their faith in him was a constant source of happiness for him. As the <b>Prime Minister</b>,
       Nehru wanted to "create an atmosphere in the country where the attention is constantly focused on children and their welfare".</p>
<p>►   However, after<b> Nehru's passing in 1964,</b> the Indian government decided to honour his legacy by marking his birthday as <u><b>Children's Day.</u></b> Since then, <u><b>November 14 </b></u>has been dedicated
       to celebrating children and their importance in society.</p>
<p>►   While Nehru's birthday (14 November) had publicly been celebrated all over India since 1947, with public meetings being organised to pay tribute to him and games for children
       being held.</p>
<p>►   It was only in 1954 that the day was first celebrated as<b><u> "Children's Day"</b></u>. More than 50,000 schoolchildren attended the celebrations in National Stadium in Delhi.</p>
<p>►   In 1957, 14 November was officially declared<b> Children’s Day</b> in India by a special government edict.The Government of India's Department of Posts and Telegraphs issued first day
       covers and three commemorative stamps on the occasion of <b>Bal Diwas</b> ("Children's Day").</p>
<p>►   Children's Day serves as a reminder of the crucial role children play in shaping the future of India. It emphasises the importance of providing them with access to quality education,
       healthcare, and a nurturing environment to foster their growth and development. The day also highlights the need to<strong> protect children's rights and safeguard</strong> their well-being.</p>
<p>►   Children's Day is marked by expressions of love, gifts and pampering of students and as a part of the celebrations and festivities, exchange of gifts like books and cards also takes 
      place.</p>
<p>►   World Children’s Day was first established in 1954 as <b>Universal Children's Day</b> and is celebrated on 14 November each year to promote international togetherness, awareness among children 
	 worldwide, and improving children's welfare.</p>
<p>►   November 14th is an important date as it is the date in 1959 when the <i>UN General Assembly </i>adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. It is also the date in 1989 when the UN General 
       Assembly adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>►   Since 1990, <b>World Children's Day</b> also marks the anniversary of the date that the UN General Assembly adopted both the Declaration and the Convention on children's rights.</p>
<p>►   Mothers and fathers, teachers, nurses and doctors, government leaders and civil society activists, religious and community elders, corporate moguls and media professionals, as well as young people  
    and children</p>
<p>►   <b>World Children's Day </b>offers each of us an inspirational entry-point to advocate, promote and celebrate children's rights, translating into dialogues and actions that will build a better world for children.</p>
